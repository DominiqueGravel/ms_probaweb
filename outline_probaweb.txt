Question:What are the processes explaining how we move from a regional network (a metaweb) to a local one?

Objective: Propose a quantitative framework to understand and predict the spatial and temporal variation in network structure


Framework description 
- The object of interest: P(L,Xi,Xj)
- The metaweb: P(L|Xi,Xj)
- Variants: effect of the environment
- The co-occurrence matrix P(Xi,Xj)
- Variants: effect of the environment, neutral, conditional on interactions

Link to the niche 
- Definitions: joint impacts of environmental dependence and effects
- Problem with the original definition
- Interpretation of the framework in terms of eltonian and Grinnellian niches
- The meaning of marginals
- Network indices

Methods for building up the model
- Contingency tables
- GAM
- Inference of the metaweb
- Example with Tylianakis' data


Applications
1. Null model testing

2. Retrieving the Eltonian niche (metaweb)

3. Retrieving the Grinnellian niche

4. Assessing beta diversity

5. Forecasting species distribution conditional on interactions
