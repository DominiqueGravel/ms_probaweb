\section*{Abstract} 

Biogeography has historically focused on the spatial distribution and
abundance of species, neglecting variation in the way species interact with
each other. Models of species distribution and of interactions have
historically taken different paths. Here, we plea for an integrated approach,
adopting the view that community structure is best represented as an
ecological network of interactions. We outline a conceptual approach,
suggesting that the ecological niche may be redefined to encompass the effect
of the environment on species distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the
niche) and on the ecological interactions among them (the Eltonian dimension).
Starting from this novel concept, we develop a quantitative theory to explain
turnover of interactions in space and time – i.e. a novel approach to
interaction distribution modelling. We apply this novel framework to a large
data set of host–parasite interactions across Europe and find that two aspects
of the environment (temperature and precipitation) leave a strong imprint on
species co-occurrence, but not on the probability of local interactions. Even
where species co-occur, interaction proves a stochastic rather than
deterministic process, adding to variation in realized network structure. We
also find that a large majority of species pairs are never found together,
thus precluding any inferences regarding their probability to interact. Our
framework provides a first conceptual framework to explain the variation of
network structure at large spatial scales and opens new perspectives at the
frontier between species distribution modelling and community ecology.

\section*{Introduction}

Community ecology is defined in most textbooks as \textit{the study of the
interactions that determine the distribution and abundance of organisms}
\citep{Krebs2001}. Despite a general consensus on this definition
(Scheiner2007), research on variation in community
structure has mostly focused on the spatial and temporal turnover of species composition
\citep{Anderson2011}, neglecting variation in the way species interact with
each other \citep{Poisot2015a}. Given this omission, it is perhaps not
surprising that biogeographers are still struggling to establish whether
interactions actually impact the distribution of species at large spatial
scales\citep{Wisz2012, Kissling2012}, even though there is enough evidence
from community ecology that interactions are critical for determining species
dynamics, resource use and responses to the environment af finer scales.
Recent attempts at accounting for interactions in species distribution models
\citep{Pollock2014, Pelissier2013} have brought some methodological advances.
Yet, these techniques are still based on a `species-based' approach to
communities, where interactions are merely treated as fixed covariates
affecting distribution.

As a more explicit description of interactions among species, the
network approach offers a convenient representation of communities. Species
are represented as nodes and interactions by links. To date, studies of
network diversity have mostly been concerned with the distribution of
interactions within locations, and less so with the variation among locations
\citep{Dunne2005, Bascompte2007, Ings2007, Kefi2012}. There is however 
ample evidence that interaction networks vary in space and time
\citep{Laliberté2010, Poisot2012, Albouy2014, Poisot2016, Trojelsgaard2015}. Metacommunity
theory provides explanation for the variation in the distribution of the
different nodes \citep{Gravel2011c, Pillai2011}, but there is no explanation
to the joint variation of node and link occurrences. We urgently need a
conceptual framework to formalize these observations.

Given the historically different approaches to modelling the distributions of
species vs. interactions, there is an evident need to bring the two together.
Here, we offer an integrated approach, adopting the view that community
structure is best represented as an ecological network of interactions. Based
on this idea, we propose a new description of the basic concept of the
ecological niche, now integrating the effect of the environment on species
distribution and on the ecological interactions among them. Starting from this
redefined concept, we develop a quantitative theory to explain turnover of
interactions in space and time. We first present the conceptual framework, and
then formalize it mathematically, using a probabilistic model to represent the
sampling of the regional pool of interactions. At the level of species pairs,
the statistical approach could be conceived as an interaction distribution
model. At the community level, the approach provides a likelihood-based method
to compare different hypotheses of network turnover. We apply this novel
framework to a large data set on host–parasite interactions across Europe and
find that variation of the environment causes turnover of both species and
interactions. The network structure changes systematically across the
latitudinal gradient, with a peak of connectance at intermediate latitude.

%=============================================================================%
\section*{The two dimensions of community structure}

The problem of community assembly is often formulated as \textit{how are
species sampled from a regional pool to constitute a local community
\citep{Gotzenberger2012}?} This question could be rewritten to address the
problem of network assembly, as \textit{how do samples from a regional pool of
interactions constitute a local interaction network?} An illustration of this
problem for a food web is provided in Figure 1. The metaweb represents
potential interactions among all species that could be found in a given area.
In this particular case, there are 275 nodes, and 1173 links among plants (52
nodes), herbivores (96 nodes), and parasitoids (127 nodes) from Northern
Europe. An instance of a local community is also illustrated, with 45 nodes
and 93 interactions. Only 55.0\% of all potential interactions are realized,
revealing the stochastic nature of ecological interactions. Our objective here
is to provide a conceptual framework to explain the sampling of the regional
pool of interactions, along with a quantitative method to predict it. The
problem could be formalized sequentially by first understanding why only a
fraction of the species are co-occurring locally and second why these species
do or do not interact.

There are multiple causes of spatial turnover in community composition. The
first and most-studied driver is the effect of variation in the abiotic
environment on species performance. Combined with specific responses in
demography, it generates variation among sites by selecting the locally
fittest species \citep{Leibold2004}. Stochasticity plays an additional role,
either colonization and extinction events \citep{Hanski1999} are inherently
unpredictable, or because of strong non-linear feedbacks in community dynamics generating alternative
transients and equilibria \citep{Chase2007, Vellend2014}. Analyses of
community turnover are usually performed with data represented in a table with
rows corresponding to sites (or measurements) and columns to species. Metrics
of beta diversity quantify the variance of this community data
\citep{Legendre2005}. Traditional approaches rely on measures of dissimilarity
among communities, such as the Jaccard or Bray–Curtis indices. A more recent
approach decomposes the total variation of the community data into species and
site contributions to beta diversity \citep{Legendre2013}. Even though these
methods compare whole lists of species among sites or measurements, they
remain fundamentally ’species-based’, since they report the variation within
columns. None of them explicitly considers the variation of associations
(i.e., of pairs or higher-order motifs – \citealt{Stouffer2007}).

The "niche" is by far the dominant concept to explain species distributions
and community assembly, from the local to the global scale. Following
\citealt{Hutchinson1957}, the niche is viewed as the set of environmental
conditions allowing a population to establish and persist (see also
\citealt{Holt2009}). Community turnover arises as a result of successive
replacement of species along an environmental gradient, in agreement with the
Gleasonian view of communities \citep{Gleason1926}. The concept is
straightforward to operationalize with species distribution models, as it maps
naturally on available distributional and environmental data. In consequence,
a vast array of statistical tools have been developed to implement it (e.g.
BIOMOD \citealt{Thuiller2003}, MaxEnt \citealt{Phillips2006}). It is however
much harder to account for ecological interactions with this approach
\citep{Peterson2011}. As such, these interactions are often viewed as externalities
constraining or expanding the range of environmental conditions required for a
species to maintain a viable population \citep{Pulliam2000, Soberon2007, Boulangeat2012}.

As mentioned above, in the network approach to community structure, species
and interactions are represented by nodes and links, respectively.
Associations can also be represented by matrices in which entries represent
the occurrence or intensity of interactions among species (rows and columns).
Network complexity is then computed as the number of interactions (in the case
of binary networks) or interaction diversity (in the case of quantitative
networks, \citealt{Bersier2002}). Variability in community structure
consequently arises from the turnover of species composition, along with
turnover of interactions among pairs of species. The occurrence and intensity
of interactions could vary because of the environment, species abundance, and
higher-order interactions \citep{Poisot2015a}. Variation in community
composition was found independent of the variation of ecological interactions,
suggesting that these two components of network variability respond to
different drivers \citep{Poisot2012}.

Interestingly, the ecological network literature also has its own ’niche
model’ to position a species in a community \citep{Williams2000}. The niche of a
species in this context represents the multidimensional space of all of its
interactions. Each species is characterized by a niche position, an optimum
and a range over 3 to 5 different niche axes \citep{Williams2000, Eklof2013}.
The niche model of food web structure and its variants have successfully explained the
complexity of a variety of networks, from food webs to plant–pollinator
systems \citep{Allesina2008, Williams2010, Eklof2013}. This
conceptual framework is, however, limited to local communities, and does not
provide any explanation for the turnover of network structure along
environmental gradients.

%=============================================================================%
\section*{The integrated niche}

A more integrative description of the niche is key to understand spatial and
temporal turnover in community structure. Despite several attempts to update
the concept of the ecological niche, ecologists have not moved far past the
``n-dimensional hypervolume'' defined by Hutchinson. Despite its intuitive
interpretation and easy translation into species distribution models
\citep{Boulangeat2012, Blonder2014}, the concept has been frequently
criticized \citep{Hardin1960, Peters1991, Silvertown2004}, and several
attempts have been made to expand and reinforce it \citep{Pulliam2000,
Chase2003, Soberon2007, Holt2009, McInerny2012b}.

Part of the problem surrounding the niche concept has been clarified with the
distinction between Eltonian and Grinnellian definitions \citep{Chase2003}. The
Grinnellian dimension of the niche is the set of environmental conditions
required for a species to maintain a population in a location. The Grinnellian
niche is intuitive to apply, and constitutes the conceptual backbone of
species distribution models. The Eltonian niche, on the other hand, is the
effect of a species on its environment. This aspect of the niche is well known
by community ecologists, but is trickier to turn into predictive models.
Nonetheless, the development of the niche model of food web structure
\citep{Williams2000} and its parameterization \citep{Williams2010; Gravel2013}
made it more operational.

These perspectives are rather orthogonal to each other, which has resulted in
considerable confusion in the literature \citep{McInerny2012a}.
\citealt{Chase2003} attempted to reconcile with the following definition:
``[The niche is] the joint description of the environmental conditions that
allow a species to satisfy its minimum requirements so that the birth rate of
a local population is equal to or greater than its death rate along with the
set of per capita effects of that species on these environmental conditions''.
Their representation merges zero-net growth isoclines delimiting the
Grinnellian niche (when does the population persists) with impact vectors delimiting
the Eltonian niche (what is the per-capita impact). While this representation
has been very influential in local-scale community ecology (the resource-ratio
theory of coexistence, \citealt{Tilman1982}), it remains impractical at larger
spatial scales because of the difficulties to measure it. The absence of any
mathematical representation of the niche that could easily be fitted to
ecological data may explain why biogeographers are still struggling to develop
species distribution models that also consider ecological interactions.

We propose to integrate the two perspectives of the niche with a visual
representation of both components (Fig. 2). The underlying rationale is that, in
addition to the environmental constraints on demographic performance, any
organism requires resources to sustain its metabolic demands and reproduction.
Abiotic environmental axes are any non-consumable factors affecting the
demographic performance of an organism. Alternatively, the resource axes are
traits of the resources that allow interactions with the consumer. The niche
should therefore be viewed as the set of abiotic environmental factors (the
Grinnellian component) along with the set of traits (the Eltonian component)
that allow a population to establish and to persist at a location. Accordingly,
each species can be characterized by an optimal position in both the
environmental (x-axis) and the trait (y-axis) plane. The integrated niche is
then the hypervolume where interactions can occur and sustain a population.
This approach radically changes the representation of the niche, putting the
distributions and ecological interactions of species in the same formalism.
The limits of the niche axes could be independent of each other (as in the
example of Fig. 2), or alternatively interact. For instance, the optimal
prey size for predatory fishes could decline with increasing temperature
\citep{Lelong2015}, which would make diet boundaries functions of the
environment. The other way around, we could also consider that the growth rate
of the predator changes with the size of its prey items, thereby altering the
environmental boundaries.

%========================================================%
\section*{A probabilistic representation of interaction networks in space}

We now formalize the integrated niche with a probabilistic approach to
interactions and distributions. We seek to represent the probability that an
interaction between species $i$ and $j$ occurs at location $y$. We define
$L_{ijy}$ as a stochastic variable, and are looking at the probability that
this event occurs, $P(L_{ijy})$. The occurrence of an interaction is dependent
on the co-occurrence of species $i$ and $j$. This argument might seem trivial
at first, but the explicit consideration of this condition in the
probabilistic representation of ecological interactions will prove fundamental
to understand their variation. We define $X_{iy}$ as a stochastic variable
representing the occurrence of species $i$ at location $y$. The quantity we seek to
understand is the probability of a joint event, conditional on the set of
environmental conditions $E_y$:

%-----------------
\begin{equation}
	\text{P}(X_{iy},X_{jy},L_{ijy}|E_y)
\end{equation}
%-----------------

Or simply said, the probability of observing both species $i$ and $j$ plus an
interaction between $i$ and $j$ given the conditions $E_y$. This probability
could be decomposed into two parts using the product rule of probabilities:

%-----------------
\begin{equation}
	P(X_{iy},X_{jy},L_{ijy}|E_y)=P(X_{iy},X_{jy}|E_y)P(L_{ijy}|\mathbf{T},X_{iy},X_{jy},E_y)
\end{equation}
%-----------------

The first term on the right-hand side of the equation is the probability of
observing the two species co-occurring at location $y$. It corresponds to the
Grinnellian dimension of the niche. The second term represents the probability
that an interaction occurs between species $i$ and $j$, given their set of
traits $T$ and that they are co-occurring. Above, we refer to this entity
as the "metaweb" and it corresponds to the Eltonian dimension of the niche. Below,
we will see how this formalism can be directly fitted to empirical data. But
before turning to an application, we will discuss the interpretation of
different variants of these two terms.

\subsection*{Variants of co-occurrence}

There are several variants to the co-occurrence probability, representing
different hypotheses about temporal and spatial variation in network structure
(see the explicit formulations in Table 1). The simplest model relates the
probability of co-occurrence directly to the environment, $P(X_{iy},X_{jy}|E_y)$.
In this situation there are no underlying assumptions about the ecological
processes responsible for co-occurrence. It could arise because interactions
do constraint distribution \citep{Pollock2014, Cazelles2016} or,
alternatively, because of environmental requirements shared between $i$ and
$j$. In the former case, species are not independent of each other and the
conditional occurrence must be accounted for explicitly, $P(X_{iy},X_{jy}
|E_y)=P(X_{iy}|E_y,X_{jy})P(X_{jy}|E_y)$. In the latter case, species are
independent and only the marginal occurrence must be accounted for, $P(
|E_y)=P(X_{iy} |E_y)P(X_{jy} |E_y)$.

The co-occurrence probability itself could depend on ecological interactions.
This should be viewed as the realized component of the niche (i.e. the
distribution when accounting for species interactions). Direct pairwise
interactions such as competition, facilitation, and predation have long been
studied for their impact on co-distribution (e.g. \citealt{Diamond1976, Connor1980,
Gotelli2000}. Second- and higher-order interactions (e.g. trophic cascades)
could also affect co-occurrence. Co-occurrence of multiple species embedded in
ecological networks is a topic of its own, however, and is influenced by both network
topology and species richness \citep{Cazelles2016}. Not only direct interactions do
influence co-occurrence, but indirect interactions do as well (e.g. plant species
sharing an herbivore could repulse each other in space). The impact of direct
interactions and first-order indirect interactions on co-occurrence tends to
vanish with increasing species richness in the community. Further, co-occurrence
is also influenced by the covariance of interacting species to an
environmental gradient \citep{Cazelles2015}. Because of the complexity of relating
co-occurrence to the structure of interaction networks, we will here focus on
the variation of interactions and not on their distribution, and leave this
specific issue for the Perspectives and future research.

\subsection*{Variants of the metaweb}

There are also variants of the metaweb. First, most documented metawebs have
thus far considered ecological interactions to be deterministic, not
probabilistic (e.g. \citealt{Havens1992, Wood2015}). Species are assumed to interact
whenever they are found together in a location, independent of their
local abundance and the local environment. In other words, $P(L_{ijy}|X_{ijy}=1) = 1$
and $P(L_{ijy}|X_{ijy}=0) = 0$. This approach might be a reasonable
approximation if the scale of sampling and inference is so large that the
probability of observing at least one interaction converges to unity and the
only variation in the networks considered arises from species distributions.

Ecological interactions could also vary with the environment, so that $P(L_{ijy}
|E_y)$. Although it is not common to see a conditional representation of
pairwise ecological interactions, experimental studies have revealed them to
frequently be sensitive to the environment. For instance, \citep{Mckinnon2010} showed
that predation risks of shorebirds vary at the continental scale, decreasing
from the south to the north. It is also common to see increasing top-down
control with temperature (e.g. \citealt{Shurin2012, Gray2016}). Effects of the
environment on interactions also propagate up the community and influence network
structure \citep{Tylianakis2007, Woodward2010; Petchey2010; Lelong2015}.

%========================================================%

\section*{Application: continental-scale variation of host-parasite community structure}

We now turn to an illustration of the framework with the analysis of an
empirical dataset of host–parasite networks sampled throughout the south–north
environmental gradient in continental Europe. The focal system consists of local food webs
of willows (genus Salix), their galling insects, and the parasitoids of
these gallers. Targeting this system, we ask: i) how much does network
structure vary across the gradient, and ii) what is the primary driver of
network turnover across the gradient?

\subsection*{Data}  

Communities of willows, gallers, and parasitoids are species-rich and
widely distributed, with pronounced variation in community composition across
space. The genus Salix includes over 400 species, most of which are shrubs or
small trees \citep{Argus1997}. The genus is common in most habitats across the
Northern Hemisphere \citep{Skvortsov1999}. Willows support a highly diverse
community of herbivorous insects, with one of the main herbivore groups being
gall-inducing sawflies (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae: Nematinae: Euurina
\citep{Kopelke1999}). Gall formation is induced by sawfly females during
oviposition, and includes marked manipulation of host-plant chemistry by the
galler \citep{Nyman2000}. The parasitoid community includes nearly
100 species belonging to 17 insect families of four orders
\citep{Kopelke2000}. These encompass two main types: inquiline larvae
(Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera) feed primarily on gall
tissue, but typically kill the galler larva in the process, while parasitoid
larvae (representing many families in Hymenoptera) kill the galler larvae by
direct feeding \citep{Kopelke2003}. In terms of associations between the
trophic levels, phylogeny-based comparative studies have demonstrated that
galls represent ``extended phenotypes'' of the gallers, meaning that gall form,
location, and chemistry is determined mainly by the galling insects and not by
their host plants \citep{Nyman2000}. Because galler parasitoids have to
penetrate a protective wall of modified plant tissue in order to gain access
to their victims, gall morphology has been inferred to strongly affect the
associations between parasitoids and hosts \citep{Nyman2007}. Thus, the set of
parasitoids attacking each host is presumably constrained by the form,
size, and thickness of its gall.

Local realizations of the willow–galler–parasitoid network were reconstructed
from community samples collected between 1982 and 2010. During this period,
willow galls were collected at 370 sites across Central and Northern Europe.
Sampling was conducted in the summer months of June and/or July, i.e., during
the later stages of larval development. Galler species were identified on the
basis of willow host species and gall morphology, as these are distinct for
each sawfly species. At each site, galls were randomly collected from numerous
willow individuals in an area of about 0.1–0.3 $km^2$. Some sites were visited
more than once, with a total of 641 site visits across the 370 sites. GPS
coordinates were recorded for each location; for our analyses, the present day
annual mean temperature and precipitation were obtained from WorldClim using
the R package raster \citep{Hijmans2015}. While other covariates could have
also been considered, these variables are likely representative of the most
important axes of the European climate, and more easily interpretable than
reduced variables obtained by e.g. principal component analysis.

The methods used for rearing parasitoids from the galls have been
previously described by , Kopelke2003}. In brief, galls were
opened to score the presence of galler or parasitoid/inquiline larvae. Parasitoid
larvae were classified to preliminary morphospecies, and the identity of each
morphospecies was determined by connecting them to adults emerging after
hibernation. The galls were reared by storing single galls in small glass
tubes \citep{Kopelke1985a}. Hibernation of galls containing parasitoids took place
either within the glass tubes or between blotting paper in flowerpots filled
with clay granulate or a mixture of peat dust and sand. These pots were stored
over the winter in a roof garden and/or in a climatic chamber. In most cases,
the matching of larval morphospecies with adult individuals emerging from the
rearings allowed the identification of the parasitoids to the species
level. Nonetheless, in some cases, individuals could only be identified to one
of the (super)families Braconidae, Ichneumonidae, and Chalcidoidea. This was
particularly the case when only remains of faeces, vacant cocoons of
parasitoids, and/or dead host larvae were found, as was the case when
parasitoids had already emerged from the gall. As a result, the largest taxon
in the data set, ``Chalcidoidea indeterminate'', represents a superfamily of
very small parasitoids that are hard to distinguish.

In total, 146,622 galls from 52 Salix taxa were collected for dissection and
rearing. These galls represented 96 galler species, and yielded 42,133
individually-identified parasitoids. Of these, 25,170 (60\%) could be
identified to the species level. Overall, 127 parasitoid taxa were
distinguished in the material. Data on host associations within subsets of
this material have been previously reported by \citep{Kopelke1999} and
\citep{Nyman2007}. The current study represents the first analysis of
the full data set from a spatial perspective.

\subsection*{Analysis}  

Computing the probability of observing an interaction involves fitting a set
of binomial models and collecting their estimated probabilities. For the sake
of illustration, we considered second-order generalized linear models –
whereas more flexible fitting algorithms (e.g. GAM or Random Forest)
could equally well be used, as long as the algorithm can estimate the
probability for each observation. The data consist of a simple (albeit large
and full of zeros) table with the observation of each species, $X_{iy}$ and $X_{jy}$,
their co-occurrence, $X_{ijy}$, the observation of an interaction $L_{ijy}$, and
environmental co-variates $E_y$. Thus, there is one row per pair of species per
site. We considered that an absence of a record of an interaction between co-occurring
species at a site means a true absence (see below for a discussion
on this issue).

We compared three models for the co-occurrence probability. The first one
directly models the co-occurrence probability conditional on the local
environment, $P(X_{iy},X_{jy}|E_y)$ (models are listed at Table 1 and 2).
Hence, this model makes no assumptions about the mechanisms driving co-
occurrence for any given environment, and instead uses the information directly
available in the data. It thereby indirectly accounts for the effect of
interactions on co-occurrence, if there is any. The second model considers
independent occurrence of species. In this case, we independently fit
$P(X_{iy} |E_y)$ and $P(X_{jy} |E_y)$, then we take their product to derive
the probability of co-occurrence. This model should be viewed as a null
hypothesis with respect to the first model, since a comparison between the
respective models will reveal if there is significant spatial association of
the two species beyond a joint response to the shared environment
\citep{Cazelles2015}. Finally, the third model assumes that the probability of
co-occurrence is independent of the environment and thus constant throughout
the landscape. In other words, $P(X_{iy},X_{jy})$ is obtained by simply counting the
number of observed co-occurrences divided by the total number of observations.
Thus, the comparison between the first and third model allows us to test the
hypothesis that co-occurrence is conditional on the environment. Whenever the
environment was included as a covariate in the GLM, we considered a second-
order polynomial response for both temperature and precipitation. There are
consequently 5 parameters for the first model when fitting a given pair of
species, 10 parameters for the second, and only 1 for the third model.

Following the same logic, we compared three models of the interaction
probability. The first model conditions the interaction probability on the
local environmental variables, $P(L_{ijy}|X_{iy},X_{jy},E_y)$. Consequently,
the model was fit to a subset of the data where the two species co-occur.
The second model fits the interaction probability independently of the local
environmental variables, $P(L_{ijy}|X_{iy},X_{jy})$. It corresponds to the
number of times the two species were observed to interact when co-occurring,
divided by the number of times that they co-occurred. The third model is an
extreme case performed only to test the hypothesis that if two species are
found to interact at least once, then they should interact whenever they co-occur,
$P(L_{ijy}|X_{iy},X_{jy})=1$. While not necessarily realistic, this
model tests an assumption commonly invoked in the representation of local
networks from the knowledge of a deterministic metaweb. There are consequently
5 parameters for the first model, a single parameter for the second model and
no parameter to evaluate for the third model (where the interaction
probability is fixed by the hypothesis).

The different models were fitted to each pair of species and the 
predicted probabilities were recorded. The joint probability $P(L_{ijy},X_{iy},X_{jy})$
was then computed from Eq. 2, and the likelihood of each observation was
computed as $mathcal{L}(\theta_{ijy}|D_{ijy})=P(L_{ij},X_{iy},X_{jy})$ if an
interaction was observed, and as
$mathcal{L}(\theta_{ijy}|D_{ijy})=1-P(L_{ijy},X_{iy},X_{jy})$ if no
interaction was observed. The log-likelihood was summed over the entire
dataset to compare the different models by AIC. Not surprisingly, there was a
very large number of species pairs for which this model could not be computed,
as they simply never co-occurred. For these pairs, we have no information of
the interaction probability, and they were consequently removed from the
analysis. The log-likelihood reported across the entire dataset was summed
over all pairs of species observed to co-occur at least once. Interactions
between the first (Salix) and second (gallers) trophic layers and those
between the second and third (parasitoids) were considered separately.
Finally, we used the full model (in which both co-occurrence and the
interaction are conditional on the environment) to interpolate species
distributions and interaction probabilities across the entire European
continent. We reconstructed the expected network for each location in a 1km X
1km grid and computed the probabilistic connectance following
\citep{Poisot2015b}.  

All of the data are openly available in the database mangal \citep{Poisot2015c} and
all R scripts for querying and pre-processing the data, along with the
analysis, are provided in the Supplementary material.

\subsection*{Results}  

Despite the extensive sampling, many pairs of species were observed to co-occur
only a few times. This made it hard to evaluate interaction probabilities with
any reasonable confidence interval. Thus, we start with an example of a single
pair of species selected because of its high number of co-occurrences
($N_{ij}=38$): \textit{Phyllocolpa prussica} and \textit{Chrysocharis
elongata}. These two fairly abundant species, were observed $N_i=49$ and $N_j=121$
times, respectively, across the 370 sites, and they were found to
interact with a marginal probability $P(L_{ij})=0.55$, which means they
interacted at 21 different locations. Here, a comparison of model fit (Table
1) reveals that the interaction probability conditional on co-occurrence
does not better explain their distribution (Model 1 vs Model 2). Moreover, when the two
species co-occur, the occurrence of the interaction was insensitive to the
environment (Model 2 vs Model 3). Alternatively, climatic variables
significantly impacted co-occurrence (Model 3 vs Model 4). The neutral model
performed worse than the non-random co-occurrence model (Model 3 vs Model 6).
The full model revealed that the greatest interaction probability occurred at
intermediate temperature and precipitation, simply because this is where the
two species most frequently co-occur (Fig. 3). The probabilities of co-occurrence
and interaction can be represented in space, where we found that the
highest interaction probability occurred in central Europe (Fig. 4).

We evaluated each model for all pairs of species in order to better understand
the large-scale drivers of network turnover. The results were highly consistent
among trophic layers (Salix–gallers and gallers–parasitoids; Table 2). Across
all pairs of species, the conditional representation of interactions performed 
better than the marginal one (Model 1 vs Model 2); that is, interactions did
not occur systematically whenever the two species were found co-occurring.
Hence, in addition to species turnover, the stochastic nature of interactions
contributes to network variability. In total, we recorded 1,173 pairs of
interactions, only 290 of which occurred more than 5 times. Out of these 290
interactions, 143 were systematically detected whenever the two species co-
occurred. In the instances when species co-occurred, the two environmental
variables considered proved relatively poor predictors of their interactions
(Model 2 vs Model 3). Not surprisingly, for both types of interactions
(Salix–galler and galler–parasitoid), the likelihood increased when the
environment was considered. However, the extra number of parameters exceeded the
gain in likelihood and inflates AIC. Therefore, the most parsimonious model
excluded the effect of the environment. On the basis of log-likelihoods only,
co-occurrence was non-neutral for both Salix–galler interactions and
galler–parasitoid interactions. Thus, according to AIC, the best model was the
one of non-random co-occurrence (Model 3 vs Model 6) for both types of
interactions.

The approach we present not only has implications for understanding the
biogeography of pairwise interactions and interaction networks, but also the
quality of the evaluation of metawebs. We investigated the reliability of the
estimated metaweb across the entire dataset wtih summary statistics of species
co-occurrence. As mentioned above, across the 17,184 potential pairs of
species, only 1,173 pairs interacted in at least a single location, yielding a
connectance of 0.068. However, only 4,459 pairs of species were found co-
occurring at least once across all locations. There are consequently
12,725 gaps of information in the metaweb (74.1\% - see Fig. 5). As we cannot
know whether the non-co-occurring species would indeed interact when found
together, a more appropriate estimate of connectance would be
$C=1173/4459=0.263$. This result reveals that the evaluation of the sampling
quality of ecological networks is a problem on its own and well worth further
attention.

Once we had selected the best model (Model 3, Table 2), we used it to
reconstruct the expected species richness, along with the most likely network
for each location. By this approach, we could map the expected
distribution of network properties across Europe (Fig. 6). For simplicity, we
chose to consider connectance as descriptor of network configuration, as this
metric can be easily computed from probabilistic networks \citep{Poisot2015c}) and is
also a good proxy for many other network properties \citep{Poisot2014}. Overall, we
find a peak in Salix, gallers and parasitoid diversity in northern Europe. The
expected number of interactions roughly follows the distribution of species
richness, but accumulates at a rate different from species numbers.
Connectance also peaks in northern Europe (Fig. 6).

\section*{Interpretation}

We have proposed that the representation of community structure and its variation
in space and time is best represented with the formalism of ecological
networks because both the distribution of species and their interspecific
interactions can then be accounted for. We consequently revised the niche concept in
order to integrate both the abiotic and the biotic components of the niche
that are susceptible to vary over time and space. This integrated niche was
represented visually with an ordination of species into an environmental space
and a trait space. The fundamental niche of a species is represented as the
set of environmental conditions and resources that allow a species to be
maintained in a location, thereby integrating the Eltonian and the Grinnellian
components of the niche. We then translated the concept mathematically by
investigating the probability of the joint occurrences of species and 
their interaction, which should be interpreted as an interaction distribution
model. We used this approach to characterize the turnover of the structure of
ecological interactions in a tri-trophic network across Western Europe and
found that the primary driver of variation is the turnover in species
composition. To our knowledge, this is the first continental-wide analysis of
the drivers of network structure from empirical data (see \citealt{Albouy2014,
Poisot2016}).

Applying the framework to our large data set on host–parasite interactions
across Europe revealed key features in the interaction between Salix taxa, their
herbivores, and the natural enemies of these herbivores. Consistent with a
general increase in the diversity of Salix towards boreal areas
\citep{Cronk2015}, overall species richness of the networks increased towards
the north. The distribution of Salix species richness largely matched those of
gallers and parasitoids. These observations within Europe are
also matched by the ones found at a global scale for Salix \citep{Argus1997,
Cronk2015, Wu2015} and sawflies \citep{Kouki1994, Kouki1999}. Species richness
was originally presumed to show a similar "reversed latitudinal gradient" for
a common group of parasitic wasps, the Ichneumonidae, but this observation
has been challenged by findings of rather high ichneumonid diversity in the
tropics \citep{Veijalainen2013}. However, the ichneumonid subfamilies
specifically associated with sawflies (Ctenopelmatinae, Tryphoninae) are
clearly less diverse in the south.

Exactly what processes are responsible for the distribution of species
richness at different trophic levels is yet to be established (but see e.g.
\citealt{Roininen2005, Nyman2010, Leppanen2014}), but as a net
outcome of different latitudinal trends across trophic levels, the
distribution of co-occurrence and therefore of potential interactions differed
between the first and second link layers. The correlation between the expected
Salix and gallers richness was 0.73, while it was 0.58 between gallers and
their parasitoids. The ratio of herbivore to Salix species is essentially constant
across Europe, whereas each herbivore species is potentially attacked by a
richer enemy community higher latitudes (i.e. faces higher vulnerability).
Consequently, overall connectance peaks in Northern Europe (Fig. 6).

In terms of species interacting with each other, our analysis suggests that the
environment leaves a detectable imprint on species co-occurrence, but only a
slight mark on the occurrence of realized links among species in a specific
place: the probability of finding a given combination of species at a higher
and a lower trophic level at the same site was clearly affected by the
environment, whereas the probability of observing an interaction between the
two was not detectably so. This applies to the example species \textit{Phyllocolpa
prussica} and \textit{Chrysocharis elongata} (Figs 2-3), but also to all species pairs
more generally. For the example species pair, the full model revealed that the
interaction probability is highest at intermediate temperature and
precipitation, simply because this is where the two species co-occur most
often. This does not imply that species will always interact when they meet –
although this is a basic assumption in most documented metawebs to date (e.g.
\citealt{Havens1992, Wood2015}). Rather, an interaction is a stochastic process whose
probability is also influenced by the probability with which species co-occur.
What we cannot reliably know is how this stochasticity splits into two
sampling processes – i.e., the extent to which a species at the higher trophic
level runs into a species at the lower level co-occurring at the site, and the
extent to which this interaction is detected by an observer collecting a
finite sample. Future work will be required to document the relative
importance of these two sources of uncertainty in the occurrence of
interactions.

%========================================================%
\section*{Perspectives}

Evidence that the structure of ecological networks does vary across habitats
(e.g. \citealt{Tylianakis2007, Plein2012}), over environmental gradients
\citealt{Lurgi2010} and in time \citep{Trolsgaard2015} is accumulating
rapidly. It is not clear however to what extent the turnover of network
structure is driven by a systematic change in species composition or of
pairwise interactions \citep{Poisot2012, Poisot2015a}. The model comparison of
the host-parasite interactions revealed that most of the turnover is driven by
a species-specific response to the environment, impacting species richness,
and that co-occurrence was mostly neutral. Further, the occurrence of
interactions in presence of the host and parasite is highly stochastic, but
not predictable according to the variables we considered. We know that
interactions vary with the environment in other systems, for instance,
herbivory \citep{Shurin2012}, predation \citep{McKinnon2010, Legagneux2014}
are often found increasing with temperature, resulting in spatial variation of
trophic cascades \citep{(Gray2016}. What remains unclear, however, is the
extent to which such variation is driven by a turnover of species composition
along gradients, or a turnover of the interactions. Here we found that
interactions vary substantially, but not predictably along the annual
temperature and the precipitation gradient. Perhaps we have not found a strong
signal of the effect of the environment on the occurrence of interactions
because we had wrong covariates. It was indeed found previously for a similar
system that habitat characteristics are the primary drivers of interactions
\citep{Nyman2015}. New investigations with other systems will be required to
challenge this result. Documenting the relationship between the occurrence of
interactions at the continental scale and the environment is critical to
understand how trophic regulation at large spatial scales do influence
community dynamics and ecosystem functioning  \citep{Harfoot2013}.

We restricted our framework to the effect of co-occurrence on ecological
interactions and neglected the inverse of the problem. We did not investigated
in depth the drivers of co-occurrence and simply took it for granted from the
data. Co-occurrence was indeed many times significantly different from the
expectation of independent species distribution. It thus raises the question
that, once accounting for the species-specific effect of the environment on
distribution, are there significant effects of interactions on co-occurrence?
We could rephrase this problem asking if the fundamental niche differs from
the realized niche, and how it applies to our framework. For example, we have
considered above simply the co-occurrence probability, $P(X_{iy},X_{jy}|E_y)$,
which could be expanded as  $P(X_{iy}|X_{jy},E_y) P(X_{jy}| E_y )$. The
marginal occurrence probability, $P(X_{jy}|E_y )$, could be considered as a
species distribution model taking into account the interaction between these
species after some re-arrangement of Eq. 2. This derivation would however
critically depend on a strong a priori expectation of the conditional
probability of observing a species given the distribution of the other
species. This assumption seems reasonable for some situations, such as a
parasitoid species that requires a host to develop. On the other hand, we
found the strength of this association is often rather weak if not neutral
(with the example pair for instance analysed at Table 1). The lack of an
association could simply arises when the parasitoid is generalist enough so
that it is not constrained to track the distribution of its host
\citep{Cazelles2015}. At present, there is only indirect support to the
hypothesis that interacting species are conditionally distributed and it
should be the topic of more specific hypothesis testing. The impact of
ecological interactions on the distribution of co-occurrence has been the
topic of many publications since \citeal{Diamond1975} seminal study on
competition and the checkerboard distribution, but only recently pairwise
approaches received attention \citep{Veech2013}. It therefore remains unclear
if two interacting species are more closely associated in space because most
approaches based on null models consider community-level metrics (e.g.
\citealt{Gotelli2000}), such as the C-score, thereby making it hard to
evaluate if specific interactions do indeed affect co-occurrence. The
expansion of the framework we described to account for the difference between
the realized and the fundamental niche will therefore require further
investigation of the impact of interactions on co-occurrence.

Ecological networks are known to be extremely sparse, \emph{i.e.} having far
more absences of interactions that they have interactions. These absences of
interactions, however, can come from different sources. The fact that unequal
sampling at the local scale can affect our understanding of network structure
is well documented \citep{Martinez1999}. However, in a spatial context, some
interactions may be undocumented because the species involved have never been
observed to co-occur. Although these are reported as a lack of interactions,
in actuality we can not make inference about them since they have never been
observed: it remains possible that this interaction may happen should the two
species co-occur. A second category of absences of interactions are those that
are reported after multiple observations of species co-occurence. However, so
as to have a confidence in the fact that the probability of an interaction is
low, extensive sampling (that is, several records of co-occurence) is needed. Generally,
our confidence that the interaction is indeed impossible will increase with
the number of observations of the species pair. Seeing that this is essentially
a Bernoulli process (the probability that the species will interact given
their presence), the breadth of the confidence interval is expected to
saturate after a fixed number of observations, which can be set as a threshold
above which a species pair has finally been observed "often enough".

\section*{Conclusion}

Understanding the drivers of the spatial variation in network structure is a
key problem to solve in order to anticipate the impacts of global changes on
biodiversity. Our representation of the spatial variation of community
structure presents a new approach for the study of the biogeography of ecological
networks. We see the following key challenges and opportunities ahead in this
exciting area of research:

\textbf{1. New generation of network data}. The investigation of the spatial
variation of network structure will require high quality and highly replicated
network data. We have investigated one the most comprehensive spatial network
datasets we are aware of and nonetheless found immense gaps of knowledge in its
resolution. Species richness accumulates much faster than observations of
ecological interactions \citep{Poisot2012}. Each pair of species must be
observed several times to have reliable estimates of their interaction
probability.

\textbf{2. Estimation of the reliability of interactions}. We need quantitative tools
to estimate the confidence interval around an estimate of interaction
probability, as well as some estimation of the rate of false absences.
Bayesian methods are promising to that end because we could use information on
the target species (e.g. if they are known as specialists or generalists) to
provide prior estimates of the interaction probability.

\textbf{3. From interaction probabilities to a distribution of network properties}.
Metrics are available to analyse the structure of probabilistic networks
\citep{Poisot2015c}. These metrics are useful as first approximation, but they
assume independence among interactions. This might not be the case in nature
because of the role of co-occurrence and shared environmental requirements. We
also need to better understand the distribution of network properties arising
from probabilistic interactions.

\textbf{4. Investigation of the environmental-dependence of ecological interactions}.
There is evidence that interactions can vary in space, but this problem has
not been investigated in a systematic fashion. The paucity of the data
currently available precludes an extensive analysis of this question.

\textbf{5. Effects of ecological interactions on co-occurrence}. We have
intentionally omitted the feedback of ecological interactions on co-occurrence
in this framework. As abundance can impact the occurrence of interactions, and
inversely since interactions do impact abundance \citep{Canard2014}, we could
reasonably expect the same for co-occurrence. Theory does exist for simple
three-species modules \citep{Cazelles2015}, but the extension to entire co-
occurrence networks will prove critical, especially given the interest in
using co-occurrence to infer ecological interactions \citep{Morales2015,
Morueta-Holme2016}.

\subsection*{Figure 1}

\textbf{Non-random sampling of the metaweb}. Network assembly can be viewed as
a sampling process of the regional pool of potential interactions. Species
(indicated by colored nodes) are sampled first, and among the species found in
the local network, only some interactions (indicated by colored links) occur.
We characterize these sampling processes with the quantitative framework
proposed in this paper. As a concrete illustration of metaweb sampling, we
here show a local interaction network among Salix, gallers, andparasitoids.
The metaweb was constructed by aggregating observed interactionsb across 370
local networks.

\subsection*{Figure 2}

\textbf{Visual representation of the integrated niche}. In biogeography, the
niche is considered the set of environmental conditions where the intrinsic
growth rate $r$ is positive \citep{Holt2009}. The horizontal axis represents an
environmental gradient impacting the growth of the focal species (in red). The
location of each species along this gradient represents their optimum, and the
vertical dotted lines represent the limits of the Grinnellian niche of the
focal species. In food web ecology, the Eltonian niche represents the location
of a species in the food web, as determined by its niche position ($n$) and its
niche optimum ($c$). The vertical axis represents a niche gradient, presumably a
trait such as body size. The location of each species along this gradient
represents their niche position. The focal species will feed on preys having
niche locations within a given interval around the optimum, represented by the
horizontal lines. The integrated Grinnellian and Eltonian niche corresponds to
the square in the middle where an interaction is possible. According to our
probabilistic framework, the central square represents the area where the
joint probability of observing interactions and co-occurrence is positive.
