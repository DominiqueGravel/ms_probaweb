# Introduction

Question:What are the processes explaining how we move from a regional network (a metaweb) to a local one?

Objective: Propose a quantitative framework to understand and predict the spatial and temporal variation in network structure

# Framework description
- The object of interest: P(L,Xi,Xj)
- The metaweb: P(L|Xi,Xj)
- Variants: effect of the environment
- The co-occurrence matrix P(Xi,Xj)
- Variants: effect of the environment, neutral, conditional on interactions

# Link to the niche
- Definitions: joint impacts of environmental dependence and effects
- Problem with the original definition
- Interpretation of the framework in terms of eltonian and Grinnellian niches
- The meaning of marginals
- Network indices

# Methods for building up the model
- Contingency tables
- GAM
- Inference of the metaweb
- Example with Tylianakis' data


# Applications

## Null model testing

## Retrieving the Eltonian niche

## Retrieving the Grinnellian niche

## Assessing $\beta$-diversity

## Forecasting species distribution conditional on interactions
